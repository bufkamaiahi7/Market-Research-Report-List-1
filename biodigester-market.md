<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biodigester Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Fermentation</li><li>Wet Fermentation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The biodigester market is primarily divided into two types: dry fermentation and wet fermentation. Dry fermentation involves processing organic waste with low moisture content, making it suitable for materials like food and agricultural residues. This method is typically used in solid-state anaerobic digestion. In contrast, wet fermentation operates on high-moisture feedstock, such as manure or wastewater, leveraging liquid anaerobic digestion. Both methods convert organic waste into biogas, but they cater to different types of feedstock and operational needs.</p></p>
